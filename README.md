# Cpp-Blackjack
An assignment I completed in college, spring 2016. The goal was to create a text-based game of blackjack in C++, with a focus on utilizing concepts covered in the class, rather than efficiency. This program is intended to serve as part of a portfolio, and any possible errors have not been corrected in order to accurately reflect the work as it was.
