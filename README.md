# Cpp-Blackjack

This program can be run on any Windows computer by simply downloading and starting Blackjack.exe. The executable's code can be viewed in Blackjack.cpp.

A text-based game of blackjack in C++, with a focus on showcasing concepts I'd recently learned, rather than just efficiency. I completed this project in spring 2016.

The program features a debug mode, where the user can shuffle the deck, view the deck, and choose what card the dealer will start with.
