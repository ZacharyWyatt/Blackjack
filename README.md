# Cpp-Blackjack
An assignment I completed in college, spring 2016. The goal was to create a text-based game of blackjack in C++, with a focus on utilizing concepts covered in the class, rather than just efficiency.

The program features a debug mode, where the user can shuffle the deck, view the deck, and choose what card the dealer will start with.
